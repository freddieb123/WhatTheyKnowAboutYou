    <p> This is a project to visualise some of the data that companies hold about you. We've started with Google,
      as they seem to have the most.<br><br> The aim is to increase awareness of the data you're giving to companies.
      We are not suggesting it is a good or a bad thing.<br><br>Get started by clicking <strong>Download your Data</strong>
       and following the instructions.<br><br>This is a project I have started to learn D3.js. If you're interested in learning
     it too, or are already an expert and want to contribute, please do have a look at the <a href ='https://github.com/freddieb123/WhatTheyKnowAboutYou' target="_blank">GitHub</a>.<br><br></p>
     <h3>Example:<br><br> Where Google knows, or thinks, you have been in the world.</h3>
