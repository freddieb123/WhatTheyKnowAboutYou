    <p> Downloading your Google data is pretty easy. Here goes:
      <ol>
        <li>Go to <a href= 'https://takeout.google.com/' target="_blank">Google Takeout</a></li>
        <li>Click Deselect all (there's too much there) and then select <strong>My Activity</strong> and <strong>Location History</strong>.</li>
        <li>For both, make sure you click 'Multiple formats' and select JSON.</li>
        <li>It'll take Google a while to fetch all the data, but when it's ready, head to the other pages on this site to upload and see what's there.</li>
        <li>REMEMBER: When you upload to this site, the data stays in your browser and does not leave your computer. No data is sent to a server.</li>
      </ol>
