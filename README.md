# WhatTheyKnowAboutYou

What They Know About You is a project aimed at helping people become more aware of the data that is collected about them. It was also a good opportunity for me to learn some D3.js.

If you visit the website at www.whattheyknowaboutyou.com you will see how you can upload your data and automatically see some nice visualisations.
