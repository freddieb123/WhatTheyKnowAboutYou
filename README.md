# WhatTheyKnowAboutYou

What They Know About You is a project aimed at helping people become more aware of the data that is collected about them. It was also a good opportunity for me to learn some D3.js.

If you visit the website at www.whattheyknowaboutyou.com you will see how you can upload your data and automatically see some nice visualisations. 

The site is designed to use the HTML5 upload element, so none of your data will go anywhere near a server, it'll stay firmly on your computer!
