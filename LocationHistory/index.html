    <p> Having Google know where you are can be useful - think Google Maps. But they track your location all the time if you let them. Upload your data below to see where Google knows, or thinks, you have been in the world. <br><br>
    Instructions:<br></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Follow the instructions on the homepage to download your data from Google. You should have downloaded the <strong>Location History</strong> selection. </li>
      <li>Click upload below, and select the file called <strong>Location History.json</strong>, in the <strong>Location History</strong> folder (but not the individual years' folders). </li>
      <li>Have a look at your data that will appear below. Please be patient, sometimes the files can be large! </li>
