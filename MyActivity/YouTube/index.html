    <p>You have access to a list of all the websites where you have ever seen an advert served to you
      by Google. This is a long, boring JSON file. However you can just upload here for a nice visual summary. <br><br>
    Instructions:<br></p>
    <ol>
      <li>Follow the instructions on the homepage to download your data from Google. You should have downloaded the <strong>My Activity</strong> selection to get Ads data. </li>
      <li>Unzip the folder you downloaded, go to the My Activity folder, and then the Ads folder. </li>
      <li>Click upload below, and select the file called <strong>MyActivity.json</strong>, in the <strong>Ads</strong> folder. </li>
      <li>Have a look at your data that will appear below. You will be able to see how many ads you see, and where you see them most. </li>
